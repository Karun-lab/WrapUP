# Weather Station custom code 

Please note that this code provides a basic framework for connecting to Wi-Fi, reading data from a DHT11 sensor, and uploading it to Firebase. You will need to adapt and expand the code to integrate your specific pressure sensor and wind vane encoder.

Remember to install the required libraries (Firebase ESP32, DHT sensor, and any additional libraries for your pressure sensor) through the Arduino Library Manager. Also, replace the placeholders in the code (e.g., "your-firebase-hostname", "your-firebase-authentication", "your-ssid", "your-password") with your actual credentials and sensor setup.
